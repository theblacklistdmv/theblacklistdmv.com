When these sisters lost their jobs in the government shutdown, they made something sweet out of a sour situation.


🍰 The Furlough Cheesecake [@thefurloughcake](https://www.instagram.com/thefurloughcake/) was created by sisters Nikki and Jaqi in January 2019, during the infamous federal government shutdown. They have seen a whirlwind of success since then, including features on [@cnn](https://www.instagram.com/cnn/), [@theellenshow](https://www.instagram.com/theellenshow/), and [@owntv](https://www.instagram.com/owntv/)!



❤️ The owners Nikki and Jaqi have an incredible story, and they are very kind people as well. Not to mention they make some BOMB cheesecakes!



☕️ They also have a Latte Bar in-store, ran by Nikki’s daughter Dani!



🌱 Vegan and gluten-free options available!
