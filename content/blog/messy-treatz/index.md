🧁 It’s time to get messy!! We had the chance to visit Messy Treatz in the National Harbor this weekend! @messytreatz 🧁



😍 We LOVED the cupcakes! The cake was super moist and crumbly. The icing EVERYTHING - super soft and fluffy, similar to whipped cream! The whole thing melted in your mouth! 😍



🍪 Liz loved the Cookie Monster, with cookie bits baked into the cake!



🍎 Shi got the Apple Cobbler cupcake, with slices of apples coated in cinnamon & sugar on the top AND in the middle. The apples were sweet, but they didn’t overpower the cake flavor. Perfection in a cupcake!



💙 We got to meet the owner Brittany and her daughters, who were so nice and friendly! It’s great to have a Black-owned, woman-owned, and family-run business here at the @nationalharbor! 💙
